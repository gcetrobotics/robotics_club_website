                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>The SDGs, or Sustainable Development Goals, are a set of 17 global goals established by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They are also known as the Global Goals and include 169 sub-goals that all UN member states aim to achieve by 2030.</p>
                <p>These Sustainable Development Goals were created to address a wide range of social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the world and to promote sustainable development in all countries.</p>
                <p>According to the common definition, solutions and approaches are considered sustainable only when giving equal weight and consideration to all three dimensions and when representing a long-term, viable, and future-oriented perspective.</p>
                <p>The goal of the SDGs is to create a global transformation according to the motto "Leave no one behind". This means the world's poorest and most disadvantaged people must always be included. The SDGs do not distinguish between developed and developing countries; they apply to all.</p>
